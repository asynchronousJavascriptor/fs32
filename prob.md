# 🎓 Understanding Student Career Confusion (India, Tech Field)

> *"A student overwhelmed by a maze of career options..."*

Many Indian engineering students report feeling completely **lost** when making career decisions. Studies show that about **93% of youth know only a few mainstream fields** (like engineering, medicine, and management), even though hundreds of career paths exist.

This leaves B.Tech students, fresh graduates, and job seekers **stuck and unsure** of what to do after college.

In fact:

- **80%+ students never explore their talents/interests** before picking a career.
- **Over half regret** their career choice by age 25.
- Common panic: _“AI karu ya ML?”, “Coding seekhu ya design?”_  
- Most students **freeze out of fear** — scared of making the “wrong choice” and falling behind.
