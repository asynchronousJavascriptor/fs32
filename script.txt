Section 2 – The Emerging Player
Generative AI

Aaj ke time pe 75% workers worldwide AI use kar rahe hain in workplace. Aur 65% specifically ChatGPT use kar chuke hain. Matlab ek saal ke andar AI normal ho gaya hai.

AI skilled talent ki kami hai. Ek stat dekho: AI job postings grew 50% between 2022–2024. Matlab demand crazy hai, supply kam hai.

Aur developers ke liye to aur bhi bada game changer hai. Ek research ne bola ke developers using AI completed 126% more tasks per week than those who didn’t. Matlab 2x output.

Engagement Prompt: “Tell me in chat — have you ever used ChatGPT or Copilot to code or solve a problem? Yes or No.”

Key Message: “AI ko dushman mat samjho, use apna accelerator banao. Projects mein AI integrate karo, resume pe dikhado, aur companies ko lagna chahiye — this person is future ready.”


Section 3 - The Evergreen
DSA — Data Structures & Algorithms.
 Reddit pe engineer ne likha tha, ‘4 out of 5 interviews I had asked some kind of LeetCode-style DSA question.’ Aur dusre ne bola, ‘DSA shayad daily job mein use na ho, but interview crack karna hai to it’s non-negotiable.’

your personal experience

 👉 Engagement Prompt: “Chat mein likho — kisne LeetCode ya GFG try kiya hai kabhi?”

Key Message: “DSA is not optional. Kam se kam intermediate level tak master karo. Aur sirf code likhna mat seekho — analyze karo time complexity bhi.”



Section 4 – The off-campus knight
Aptitude & Reasoning

Ek fact: TCS, Infosys, Cognizant, sabke aptitude test cutoffs hote hain. Agar aapne aptitude lightly liya, aap interview tak nahi pohonchoge.

Mercer report ne bola — sirf 54% graduates critical thinking dikhate hain. Matlab aadhe log fail ho jaate hain issi pe.

👉 Engagement Prompt: “Tell me honestly — how many of you feel math is your weak point? Type YES if you feel so.”

Key Message: “Aptitude ko lightly mat lo. Daily 30 min practice karne se within 2-3 months you’ll see massive improvement.”
